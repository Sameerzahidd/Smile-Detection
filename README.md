## Detecting Smiles in Photos: Logistic Regression vs. CNN


This project explores the development of a machine-learning model to classify images as "smiling" or "non-smiling." Using a balanced dataset of 208 facial images, the project applies various preprocessing techniques and implements two models—Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)—to evaluate their performance in this classification task.
